Moon,

I saw you last night, You were in your complete form, full circle, your brightness was quietly lighting your surroundings.
Your reflection was on the sea, like you were looking at it all the time.
Your so beautiful as are your actions, balancing our planet with your minor gravity, managing the seas and the oceans pulling them high and low.
